# Social Meta Tags

A C# library to get social meta tags like Twitter card information and Facebook OpenGraph for a url that uses HtmlAgilityPack.

### Prerequisites

This is a netstandard2.0 library.

It uses HtmlAgilityPack (currently version: 1.11.23).

### Installing

You can 'git clone' this into your project and add it as reference.

Or you can copy the files and folders to your project.

If this project picks up steam, I will upload this to Nuget.

## Running the tests

I have some basic tests written in MSTest. You can run the test similar to how you would generally run tests (through Test Explorer or dotnet cli).
